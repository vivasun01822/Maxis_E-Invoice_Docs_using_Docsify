### Digital Certificate Update

The Digital Certificate Update section displays a list of uploaded digital certificates. Digital certificates are essential in e-invoicing as they authenticate the sender's identity, ensure the invoice's integrity, and comply with legal standards. They verify that the invoice originates from a trusted source and has not been altered during transmission. Additionally, digital certificates fulfill regulatory requirements for secure electronic transactions.

### Audit Logs

The Audit Logs feature allows you to monitor and review all application activity. You can easily track actions performed by users within the portal. This feature includes a search option to filter logs by a user's emailâ€”simply enter the email and click the `Search` button to view all operations associated with that user. Additionally, a Date Range filter lets you narrow down results to a specific time period. To reset the filters, use the `Reset` button, which clears the fields and retrieves fresh data from the database.
