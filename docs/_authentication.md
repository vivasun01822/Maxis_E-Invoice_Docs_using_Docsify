# Authentication

## Introduction

Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system. It is a critical component of security in any application, ensuring that only authorized users can access certain resources or perform specific actions.

## Password-Based Authentication

In our application, we use password-based authentication as the primary method for verifying user identity. Users provide a username and password to gain access to the system.

## Login Process

The login process typically involves the following steps:

1. **User Input**: The user enters their credentials (username and password) into the login form.
2. **Session Creation**: If the credentials are valid, the server creates a session for the user and sends back a session token or cookie.
3. **Access Granted**: The user is granted access to the application and can perform actions based on their permissions.


## Permissions and Rules

In our application, we set specific permissions and rules for users to control access to various resources and actions. This ensures that users can only perform actions they are authorized to do.

### Setting Permissions

Permissions are assigned based on user roles. Each role has a predefined set of permissions that determine what actions a user can perform. Common roles include:

1. **Admin**: Has full access to all resources and actions.
2. **Editor**: Can create, update, and delete content but has limited access to administrative functions.
3. **Viewer**: Can view content but cannot make any changes.

### Implementing Rules

Rules are implemented to enforce permissions and ensure that users can only access resources they are authorized to. This includes:

1. **Access Control**: Checking user permissions before allowing access to specific resources or actions.
2. **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Assigning roles to users and defining permissions for each role.
3. **Audit Logging**: Keeping a record of user actions to monitor and review access and changes.
